description=[h2]FAQ:[/h2]
description=What version of zomboid is this for?
description=[b]Build 41+[/b]
description=
description=Does this mod with with non-vanilla maps?
description=[b]Yes. Any map, any size.[/b]
description=
description=Does this work with on-going/old saves?
description=[b]Yes, this mod is safe to apply to an existing save. However, depending on the save's age (days into the game) you may want to adjust the mod's options from the main menu options. The "cutoffday" is when the events all end, and the system evolves the events as well as taper their occurrences. If you want to experience the mod to it's fullest, change cutoff day to 30+ the number of days you've survived so far in game.[/b]

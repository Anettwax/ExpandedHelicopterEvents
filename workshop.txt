description= [*] (Military) Increasingly Hostile Helicopter: Initially this helicopter will only make announcements but will over time begin firing on targets; at first towards the undead then later, towards players as well.
description= 
description= [*] Police Helicopter: These helicopters will patrol early on and fire on undead right away.
description= 
description= [*] News Helicopter: These helicopters will follow their target and most closely resemble the vanilla event. However, the player can use cover as well as the indoors to flee the area.
description= 
description= [*] Jets: While not strictly a "helicopter" the jet events whizz near by the player to keep things interesting and move horde of undead early on.
